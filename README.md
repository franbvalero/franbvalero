### Hi, I am Fran Valero 👋 an AI Engineer at [Supersonik](https://supersonik.ai/) where we transform SaaS sales by building AI agents that run interactive and live product demos 24/7.

#### Previously, I was an Applied Scientist at Amazon. I focused on informing customer purchase decisions by applying NLP, ML, and LLMs to customer feedback data. We built the first AI-generated product insights from customer reviews in e-commerce (see Amazon blog posts [1](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/amazon-ai/amazon-improves-customer-reviews-with-generative-ai) and [2](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-ai-generated-review-highlights)).

##### I am also the core builder of the [ESCI Benchmark dataset](https://github.com/amazon-science/esci-data) .
